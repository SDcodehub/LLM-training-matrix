Train Step Timing in LLM Training with NVIDIA NeMo and Weights & Biases Explained
In the context of Large Language Model (LLM) training using the NVIDIA NeMo framework and monitored with Weights & Biases (W&B), the "train step timing in s" refers to the duration, measured in seconds, that it takes to complete a single global training step.

This metric is a critical indicator of the training performance and efficiency of your LLM. Each training step typically involves processing a batch of data, performing a forward pass through the model, calculating the loss, executing a backward pass to compute gradients, and finally, updating the model's weights. The "train step timing" encapsulates the time taken for this entire iterative process.

According to the official NVIDIA NeMo Framework User Guide, the train_step_timing is one of the standard metrics logged during the training process, alongside others like reduced_train_loss and val_loss. These logs, including the step timing, can be directed to both TensorBoard and Weights & Biases for visualization and analysis. When W&B is configured with NeMo, it will display this "train_step_timing in s" metric, often plotted against the number of global steps, allowing you to monitor the speed of your training run.

Various NVIDIA performance benchmarks and documentation for models trained with NeMo, such as Grok-1, Llama 3.1, Nemotron-4, and GPT-3, consistently feature "Training step time (seconds per step)" or "train_step_timing in s" as a fundamental performance metric. This value is frequently used to derive other important performance indicators, such as:

Throughput: Measured in tokens per second, calculated using the sequence length, global batch size, and the train step timing.
Time to Train: An estimation of the total duration required to train the model on a specific number of tokens.
Model FLOPS Utilization (MFU): A measure of how effectively the available computational power of the GPUs is being used.
Monitoring the "train step timing" in W&B allows researchers and engineers to:

Assess the efficiency of their training setup and identify potential bottlenecks.
Compare the performance of different hardware configurations or software optimizations.
Detect fluctuations in training speed that might indicate issues.
Estimate the total time and cost required for a training run.
In summary, "train step timing in s" is a direct measure from NeMo indicating the wall-clock time for one iteration of the training loop, and it is a key metric visualized in Weights & Biases to track and optimize your LLM training jobs.

now explain me how the step size is dependent on the global size, I have give n 87 GPUS, where are my GPUs consumed.





Okay, let's break down this NeMo configuration file and discuss how global batch size relates to step timing and GPU consumption.

First, a crucial clarification:

GPU Count: Your configuration file explicitly states:
trainer.devices: 8
trainer.num_nodes: 1 This means your training job, as defined by this specific configuration, is set up to run on 8 GPUs on a single node. The mention of "87 GPUs" seems to be external to this configuration. My explanation will be based on the 8 GPUs specified in the config. If you intend to use 87 GPUs, you'd need to adjust num_nodes and potentially devices (e.g., num_nodes: 11, devices: 8 for 88 GPUs, or a combination that suits your cluster for 87, though typically devices is a power of 2, often 8 on modern systems).
Now, let's dive into the config and its implications for step timing.

Key Parameters Affecting Step Timing & GPU Utilization from your Config:

Data Configuration:

data.global_batch_size: 128: This is the total number of sequences that the model processes in one logical "step" before the optimizer updates the model weights.
data.micro_batch_size: 1: This is the batch size processed by each GPU (or more accurately, each model processing unit, considering model parallelism) in a single forward/backward pass.
data.seq_length: 8192: The length of the input sequences. Longer sequences mean more computation per sample.
data.paths: You have a list of 128 data files. NeMo will process these.
Trainer Configuration:

trainer.accumulate_grad_batches: 1: Since this is 1, gradients are not accumulated over multiple micro-batch passes. One "global step" involves processing global_batch_size / micro_batch_size total micro-batches across all data-parallel ranks, followed by an optimizer step.
trainer.max_steps: 10000: The training will run for this many global steps.
trainer.log_every_n_steps: 1: Metrics, including step timing, will be logged every global step.
Model Configuration:

model._target_: nemo.collections.llm.gpt.model.llama.LlamaModel
model.config._target_: nemo.collections.llm.gpt.model.llama.Llama3Config8B: You are training an 8-billion parameter Llama 3 model. The size and architecture of the model are primary drivers of computation per step.
Parallelism Strategy (trainer.strategy):

_target_: nemo.lightning.pytorch.strategies.megatron_strategy.MegatronStrategy
context_parallel_size: 2 (CP): The attention mechanism and sequence processing for your model are parallelized across 2 GPUs. This means a single "logical" model layer's computation is split.
pipeline_model_parallel_size: 1 (PP): The model is not split into stages across different sets of GPUs. The entire model is on each set of GPUs defined by TP and CP.
tensor_model_parallel_size: 1 (TP): Individual weight matrices within model layers are not split across GPUs.
ddp.data_parallel_sharding_strategy: optim_grads_params: This indicates that optimizer states, gradients, and parameters are sharded across your data-parallel ranks (related to Fully Sharded Data Parallelism - FSDP concept in Megatron-Core).
ddp.overlap_grad_reduce: true and ddp.overlap_param_gather: true: These are optimizations to hide communication latency by overlapping it with computation.
Precision Configuration (trainer.plugins):

fp8: hybrid and fp8_recipe: tensorwise: You are using FP8 precision for parts of the computation. FP8 can significantly speed up matrix multiplications and reduce memory bandwidth, thus reducing step time compared to BF16 or FP16 alone.
precision: bf16-mixed: The overall training is in mixed precision with bfloat16.
How GPUs are Consumed (for the 8 GPUs in the config):

Model Replica GPU footprint:

Tensor Parallelism (TP) = 1 GPU
Pipeline Parallelism (PP) = 1 GPU
Context Parallelism (CP) = 2 GPUs
GPUs per model replica = TP * PP * CP = 1 * 1 * 2 = 2 GPUs. Each complete "instance" or "replica" of your Llama 8B model (with its context processing split) requires 2 GPUs.
Data Parallelism (DP):

Total GPUs = num_nodes * devices = 1 * 8 = 8 GPUs.
Number of Data Parallel Ranks (DP Size) = Total GPUs / GPUs per model replica = 8 / 2 = 4 DP ranks. This means you have 4 identical copies of the 2-GPU model replica. Each of these 4 replicas will process a different portion of the global_batch_size.
How Global Batch Size and Step Timing are Dependent:

The "train step timing in s" is the time taken to complete one global step. Here's what happens in one global step based on your configuration:

Data Distribution: The global_batch_size of 128 samples is divided among the 4 Data Parallel (DP) ranks.

Each DP rank is responsible for global_batch_size / DP_size = 128 / 4 = 32 samples.
Micro-Batch Processing per DP Rank:

Since micro_batch_size is 1 and accumulate_grad_batches is 1, each DP rank (which spans 2 GPUs due to CP=2) will perform 32 sequential forward and backward passes on its assigned 32 samples (one sample at a time).
The computation for each sample (a forward pass and a backward pass) on these 2 GPUs (with CP=2) will take a certain amount of time. This includes:
Matrix multiplications in transformer layers (potentially accelerated by FP8).
Attention computations (split across 2 GPUs by CP).
Activations, normalizations.
Loss computation.
The total time for these 32 micro-batch passes on a DP rank contributes significantly to the step time.
Gradient Reduction/Synchronization:

After each DP rank has processed its 32 samples and computed gradients, these gradients need to be synchronized (e.g., all-reduced) across all 4 DP ranks so that every model replica arrives at the same updated weights.
The data_parallel_sharding_strategy: optim_grads_params implies an FSDP-like behavior where gradients, optimizer states, and parameters are sharded. The communication pattern here is optimized but still contributes to step time. overlap_grad_reduce: true helps hide some of this.
Optimizer Step:

The optimizer updates the model parameters using the synchronized gradients. This also takes time.
Dependence of Step Timing on Global Batch Size:

Direct Impact: If you increase global_batch_size (e.g., to 256) while keeping the number of GPUs (8) and micro_batch_size (1) the same:

Each DP rank would now process 256 / 4 = 64 samples.
This means 64 micro-batch forward/backward passes per DP rank instead of 32.
This will directly increase the train_step_timing because more computation is done within that single global step.
The gradient synchronization might also take slightly longer due to potentially larger gradient tensors being communicated (though this depends on the specifics of the sharding and reduction algorithm).
Indirect Impact & Throughput:

While a larger global_batch_size increases step time, it also means more data is processed per step. This can lead to higher overall throughput (samples/sec or tokens/sec) up to a point where the GPUs are saturated or communication becomes a bottleneck.
The goal is often to find a global_batch_size that maximizes throughput without leading to excessively long step times or out-of-memory errors.
Relationship with accumulate_grad_batches: If accumulate_grad_batches were greater than 1 (e.g., 16), then a single global step would involve 16 iterations of processing global_batch_size / accumulate_grad_batches samples before the optimizer step. This would also increase the step time proportionally compared to accumulate_grad_batches: 1 for the same effective global batch size. Your current setting of 1 means each processed micro-batch contributes directly to the current global step's gradients without further accumulation before the optimizer step.

In summary for your 8-GPU configuration:

Your "train step timing" is the time for all 4 (2-GPU) model replicas to collectively process 128 samples (32 samples each), synchronize their gradients, and for the optimizer to update the weights.
If you increase global_batch_size, the step timing will increase because more samples (and thus more micro-batches, since micro_batch_size is 1) are processed before the optimizer updates the weights.
The efficiency of this process (and thus the step time) is also heavily influenced by model size (Llama 8B), sequence length (8192), FP8 usage, and the parallelism strategy (CP=2, DP=4).
If you were to scale to more GPUs (e.g., the 87 you mentioned, or practically say 80 GPUs with num_nodes: 10, devices: 8), you would likely:

Increase your Data Parallelism (DP) size significantly.
For the same global_batch_size (128), the step time would decrease because the 128 samples would be split among many more DP ranks (e.g., 80 GPUs / 2 GPUs per replica = 40 DP ranks), so each rank processes fewer samples.
Alternatively, and more commonly, you would increase the global_batch_size proportionally to the number of GPUs to maintain good GPU utilization and potentially achieve even higher throughput, which might result in a similar or slightly increased step time compared to the 8-GPU setup but with much more data processed.

in same context, can you explain each of the following charts




Okay, let's break down each of these charts, assuming they are generated by Weights & Biases (W&B) for your NeMo LLM pre-training runs, based on the configuration file you provided earlier.

The charts show a comparison between two runs:

fp8_run_slimpajama_cs (purple line): This is likely your primary run using FP8 mixed precision as configured.
bf16_run_slimpajama (orange/pink line): This seems to be a comparative run, likely using BF16 precision without FP8, or with a different FP8 configuration.
Here's an explanation for each chart:

train_step_timing in s

What it shows: This chart plots the time taken to complete one global training step, in seconds, against the number of training steps.
Interpretation:
The purple line (fp8_run_slimpajama_cs) starts higher and then settles around 12-13 seconds per step. The initial higher values are common as the system warms up, data loaders initialize, and initial compilations might occur.
The orange line (bf16_run_slimpajama) is consistently lower, around 9-10 seconds per step.
Key Observation: This suggests that the bf16_run_slimpajama run is faster per step than the fp8_run_slimpajama_cs run. This is somewhat counter-intuitive if FP8 is expected to speed things up. Possible reasons for fp8_run_slimpajama_cs being slower could be:
Overhead associated with FP8 scaling/unscaling and recipe management if not perfectly optimized or if the model/hardware doesn't fully benefit from the specific FP8 recipe used (tensorwise with hybrid FP8 type).
Differences in other parts of the configuration between the two runs that are not visible here.
The bf16_run_slimpajama might be using a more optimized pure BF16 pathway, or it might not be using some features enabled in the FP8 run (like fp8_param_gather) which might add slight overheads.
The "warm-up" phase for the FP8 run seems longer or more pronounced.
reduced_train_loss

What it shows: This chart displays the training loss (averaged across all data-parallel ranks) as the training progresses (number of steps). The goal of training is to minimize this loss.
Interpretation:
Both lines show a clear downward trend, which is good – it means both models are learning.
The purple line (fp8_run_slimpajama_cs) and the pinkish line (bf16_run_slimpajama) are tracking very closely for most of the training. Towards the end (around step 500-600), the fp8_run_slimpajama_cs loss appears to be slightly lower or at least converging as well as the BF16 run.
Key Observation: Both precision modes seem to be achieving similar learning effectiveness in terms of loss reduction. This is a positive sign for FP8, indicating it's not significantly harming the model's ability to learn, despite the difference in step timing.
peak_memory_usage

What it shows: This chart tracks the peak GPU memory usage (likely in bytes, e.g., 6.6e+10 is 66 GB) over the training steps.
Interpretation:
The purple line (fp8_run_slimpajama_cs) shows a peak memory usage of around 6.45e+10 (64.5 GB).
The orange line (bf16_run_slimpajama) shows a slightly lower peak memory usage, around 6.40e+10 (64.0 GB).
Key Observation: This is interesting. Generally, FP8 is expected to reduce memory usage compared to BF16 for activations and potentially weights. If the bf16_run_slimpajama is using less memory, it could imply:
The FP8 run might have additional memory overheads due to FP8-specific buffers, scaling factors, or if certain parts are kept in higher precision for stability, negating some memory savings.
The fp8_param_gather setting might influence this.
There might be other configuration differences. For example, if the bf16_run_slimpajama run has a smaller global_batch_size or other memory-saving configurations not directly related to precision, it could explain its lower memory usage. (However, if it's a direct comparison, this would be unexpected).
It's also possible that the memory allocator's behavior or fragmentation leads to these reported peak values. The difference is relatively small.
num_zeros_in_grad

What it shows: This chart likely plots the number of zero values found in the gradients after the backward pass and before the optimizer step.
Interpretation:
Both runs show a very high number of zeros in the gradients (around 3.2e+8), and the values are quite noisy, fluctuating rapidly from step to step.
The purple line (fp8_run_slimpajama_cs) and the pink line (bf16_run_slimpajama) largely overlap, with similar levels of noise and magnitude.
Key Observation: A large number of zeros in gradients can sometimes indicate issues like dying ReLU units (if ReLUs are used extensively and inputs become negative) or very sparse gradients. However, for large language models, especially with techniques like gradient clipping or certain types of regularization, this might not be unusual. The important part is that both precision settings are behaving similarly. It doesn't immediately point to an advantage or disadvantage of one over the other from this chart alone, but it's a diagnostic to keep an eye on if loss plateaus or training becomes unstable.
memory_allocated

What it shows: This chart displays the amount of GPU memory allocated at each step (in bytes, e.g., 4.4e+10 is 44 GB). This is different from peak_memory_usage as it shows current allocation, not the high-water mark.
Interpretation:
The purple line (fp8_run_slimpajama_cs) shows allocated memory around 4.3e+10 (43 GB).
The pink line (bf16_run_slimpajama) shows allocated memory significantly lower, around 3.9e+10 (39 GB).
Key Observation: This again suggests the bf16_run_slimpajama is using less memory. This reinforces the observation from peak_memory_usage. The FP8 run, as configured, seems to be allocating more memory. This is an area to investigate if memory is a concern, as one would typically expect FP8 to help reduce memory footprint. This could be due to the hybrid nature of FP8 requiring certain tensors to be stored or processed in higher precision, or specific buffers required for FP8 scaling.
lr

What it shows: This chart plots the learning rate against the training steps.
Interpretation:
Both lines start from a very low learning rate and linearly increase. This is the "warmup" phase of the learning rate scheduler. Your config specifies warmup_steps: 2000.
The lines are perfectly overlapping, indicating that both runs are using the exact same learning rate schedule, as they should if the optim.lr_scheduler config is identical.
After the warmup, the learning rate would typically start to decay (e.g., following a cosine annealing schedule as configured: _target_: nemo.lightning.pytorch.optim.lr_scheduler.CosineAnnealingScheduler). The chart only shows the initial part of the training, well within the warmup phase.
Key Observation: The learning rate is being applied correctly and identically for both runs during this initial phase.
Overall Summary and Potential Next Steps:

Learning Performance: Both FP8 and BF16 runs are learning effectively, with similar loss curves. This is good.
Step Time: The BF16 run is surprisingly faster per step. This warrants investigation.
Profile both runs using NsysCallback (which you have configured: _target_: nemo.lightning.pytorch.callbacks.nsys.NsysCallback) for a few steps after the initial warmup (e.g., steps 100-105) to see where the time is being spent in the FP8 run.
Double-check if the bf16_run_slimpajama had FP8 completely disabled or if it used a different, perhaps less overhead-intensive, FP8 recipe.
Memory Usage: The FP8 run is using slightly more peak memory and notably more allocated memory. This is also counter-intuitive and should be investigated.
Again, profiling and a detailed look at memory snapshots could help.
Consider if features like fp8_param_gather or the specific hybrid FP8 mode with tensorwise recipe are contributing expectedly.
Gradient Zeros: Similar behavior for both, no immediate red flags but good to be aware of.
These charts provide valuable insights into your training dynamics. The key is to correlate them with your understanding of the configurations and, when unexpected behavior occurs (like slower step times or higher memory for FP8), to use more detailed profiling tools to pinpoint the cause.

please correct purple is the bf16 and other 2 are fp8.



can you explain how the memory allocated is different from the peak memory usage?





You are absolutely right! My apologies for misinterpreting the colors in the previous explanation.

Let's re-evaluate the charts with the correct color coding:

Purple Line: bf16_run_slimpajama (This is the BF16 run)
Orange Line & Pink Line (which seems to be another FP8 variant or continuation): fp8_run_slimpajama_cs and potentially another FP8 run if they are distinct. For simplicity, I'll refer to them collectively as the "FP8 runs."
Based on this corrected understanding, here's the revised interpretation of the charts from your first image:

train_step_timing in s

Purple Line (bf16_run_slimpajama): Starts higher and then settles around 12-13 seconds per step.
Orange/Pink Lines (FP8 runs): Consistently lower, around 9-10 seconds per step.
Corrected Key Observation: The FP8 runs are faster per step than the BF16 run. This aligns with the expectation that FP8, when implemented effectively, can reduce computation time. The initial higher values for the BF16 run might also indicate a slightly longer warm-up or initial compilation phase compared to the already optimized FP8 pathways.
reduced_train_loss

Purple Line (bf16_run_slimpajama): Shows a clear downward trend.
Orange/Pink Lines (FP8 runs): Also show a clear downward trend, tracking very closely with the BF16 run. Towards the end, the loss values for all runs appear very similar.
Corrected Key Observation: Both precision modes (BF16 and FP8) are achieving similar learning effectiveness. FP8 is not negatively impacting the model's ability to learn and reduce loss, which is a crucial positive outcome.
peak_memory_usage

Purple Line (bf16_run_slimpajama): Peak memory usage around 6.45e+10 (64.5 GB).
Orange/Pink Lines (FP8 runs): Show a slightly lower peak memory usage, around 6.40e+10 (64.0 GB) or even slightly less for one of the FP8 lines if they differ.
Corrected Key Observation: The FP8 runs are using slightly less peak GPU memory than the BF16 run. This is the expected behavior, as FP8 representations of numbers require less memory than BF16. The savings might not be dramatic for peak usage if other factors (like memory fragmentation or fixed-size buffers for other operations) dominate the peak, but a reduction is still visible and positive.
num_zeros_in_grad

No change in interpretation here, as both lines showed similar behavior previously.
Corrected Key Observation: Both BF16 and the FP8 runs exhibit similar characteristics regarding the number of zeros in gradients. This indicates that FP8 isn't drastically changing the gradient sparsity in a way that would immediately suggest a problem unique to it.
memory_allocated (Based on the first image, will address the second image separately if it shows this chart more clearly).

Purple Line (bf16_run_slimpajama): Shows allocated memory around 4.3e+10 (43 GB).
Orange/Pink Lines (FP8 runs): Show allocated memory significantly lower, around 3.9e+10 (39 GB).
Corrected Key Observation: The FP8 runs are allocating noticeably less GPU memory during the run compared to the BF16 run. This is a significant advantage of FP8, as it means more memory is available for larger models, larger batch sizes, or longer sequence lengths. This aligns with the expected benefits of using lower precision formats.
lr (Learning Rate)

No change in interpretation here.
Corrected Key Observation: The learning rate schedule is being applied identically for all runs during the depicted warmup phase.
Corrected Summary:

Learning Performance: FP8 and BF16 achieve comparable training loss.
Step Time: FP8 runs are faster per step.
Memory Usage: FP8 runs use less peak memory and notably less allocated memory.
Gradient Zeros: Similar behavior across precision types.
This corrected interpretation shows a much more favorable picture for your FP8 implementation: it's faster, uses less memory, and learns just as well as BF16 for this particular setup and duration.

Now, let's explain the difference between memory_allocated and peak_memory_usage.

memory_allocated vs. peak_memory_usage

These two metrics give different perspectives on how your program is using GPU memory:

memory_allocated (or similar terms like "current memory usage", "active memory")

What it is: This metric typically represents the total amount of GPU memory that the PyTorch (or underlying CUDA) memory allocator currently has under management and considers "in use" by tensors and other data structures at a specific point in time (usually at the end of a step when metrics are logged).
Behavior: This value can fluctuate during a training step. For instance, memory is allocated for activations during the forward pass, then some might be freed if not needed for the backward pass (though with gradient checkpointing, more activations are kept). New memory is allocated for gradients during the backward pass.
Why it's useful: It tells you how much memory your model and its current state (weights, optimizer states if on GPU, activations, gradients for the current micro-batch) are actively occupying.
peak_memory_usage (or "max memory usage", "memory high water mark")

What it is: This metric records the maximum amount of GPU memory that was allocated at any single point in time since the beginning of the training run (or since the last reset of this counter, if applicable).
Behavior: This value will only ever increase or stay the same throughout the run. If at step N the memory usage hits 50GB, and at step N+1 it hits 52GB, the peak memory will be 52GB. If at step N+2 the current usage drops to 48GB, the peak memory will still be reported as 52GB because that was the highest point reached so far.
Why it's useful: This is crucial for understanding the actual memory requirements of your training job. If your peak_memory_usage exceeds the total available GPU memory, your program will crash with an Out-of-Memory (OOM) error. It helps you determine if your model and batch size will fit on the available hardware.
Analogy:

Think of a water tank:

memory_allocated is like the current water level in the tank at the moment you check it. It can go up and down as you use water and refill it.
peak_memory_usage is like the highest water line mark left on the inside of the tank after a period of use. Even if the current water level is lower, that high-water mark tells you the maximum amount of water the tank held at one point.
In your charts (with corrected colors):

The peak_memory_usage for bf16_run_slimpajama (purple) is ~64.5 GB, while for fp8_run_slimpajama_cs (orange/pink) it's ~64.0 GB. This means at their most demanding moments, these were the memory footprints.
The memory_allocated for bf16_run_slimpajama (purple) is ~43 GB (at the points of logging), while for fp8_run_slimpajama_cs (orange/pink) it's ~39 GB. This shows that after a step completes and things might have settled (e.g., temporary buffers freed), the FP8 runs are holding onto less memory.
The fact that peak_memory_usage is significantly higher than memory_allocated (when logged at step end) is normal. It indicates that during the forward or backward pass of a training step, there are temporary allocations (like activations that are not stored for the entire step duration, or intermediate buffers for computations) that push the memory usage to its peak, but are then released before the step concludes and metrics are logged.

The second image you uploaded (image_9542c7.png) specifically shows the memory_allocated chart. With the corrected colors:

Purple Line (bf16_run_slimpajama): Flatlines around 4.42e+10 (44.2 GB).
Orange/Pink Lines (fp8_run_slimpajama_cs / FP8 runs): Flatlines also around 4.42e+10 (44.2 GB).
This is interesting! If the second image is the accurate memory_allocated chart, it suggests that after the initial allocation, the persistent memory allocated (memory not freed between steps, like model weights, optimizer states) is very similar for both BF16 and FP8 runs. This contrasts with the memory_allocated chart shown in the first composite image.

Please clarify which memory_allocated chart is the correct one to refer to. If the second image is correct, then the FP8 runs are not showing a significant advantage in persistently allocated memory at step end, even though they do show an advantage in peak memory usage (from the first image) and step time. This could mean the memory savings from FP8 are primarily in transient tensors (like activations) that contribute to the peak but are freed, or that the way memory is reported/managed leads to this observation.

why the peak is not registered in the memory allocated, it has to there?>


You're asking a very good and insightful question that gets at the heart of how these metrics are typically collected and reported in deep learning frameworks like PyTorch, which NeMo uses.

Here's why the peak_memory_usage value might not be the same as any single point on the memory_allocated graph:

Timing of Metric Collection:

memory_allocated: This metric is usually sampled at a specific, discrete point in the training loop, often at the end of a training step when other metrics like loss and learning rate are also logged. It represents the memory that is still allocated at that precise moment of sampling.
peak_memory_usage: This metric is different. The framework (or the underlying CUDA library) keeps track of memory allocations and deallocations continuously. The peak_memory_usage value is the highest point (high-water mark) that the allocated memory reached at any time during the execution up to that point (or since the last reset of the peak counter). This peak could occur in the middle of a forward pass, during a backward pass, or during an optimizer step—not necessarily at the exact moment the memory_allocated sample is taken.
Transient Allocations:

During a single training step, many tensors are created and destroyed.
Forward Pass: Activations are created for each layer. Some of these might be immediately freed if they are not needed for the backward pass (unless you're using gradient checkpointing, which saves them).
Backward Pass: Gradients are computed and stored for each parameter. Intermediate tensors used in gradient calculations are also created and freed.
Optimizer Step: The optimizer might create temporary copies of parameters or gradients, or allocate buffers for its internal states.
The actual peak memory usage often occurs during one of these intense computational phases (e.g., when the largest activations and gradients coexist).
By the time the memory_allocated metric is logged (e.g., at the end of the step, after the optimizer update), many of these transient tensors might have already been deallocated.
Analogy Revisited:

Imagine you're monitoring the number of people in a concert hall.

memory_allocated (sampled at the end of each song): You count the number of people in the hall right as each song finishes. Perhaps some people leave between songs, and others are just sitting.
peak_memory_usage (highest number of people ever in the hall): At one point, during the most popular song, a huge crowd rushed in, filling the hall to its maximum capacity. Even if many left immediately after that song, the "peak attendance" for the night would be that maximum number.
You wouldn't necessarily see that "peak attendance" if you only counted people at the end of every song, because the peak might have happened mid-song.

Why the memory_allocated Graph Doesn't Show the Peak:

The memory_allocated graph plots snapshots in time.
The actual peak usage can be very brief and happen between these snapshots.
The logging frequency for memory_allocated is typically once per training step (or every log_every_n_steps). The memory usage can fluctuate much more rapidly within a single step.
How Frameworks Track Peak Memory:

PyTorch, for example, provides functions like torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated() and torch.cuda.reset_peak_memory_stats().

torch.cuda.max_memory_allocated(): Returns the maximum GPU memory occupied by tensors in bytes for a given device. This value is updated whenever new memory is allocated, and it represents the high-water mark.
The peak_memory_usage chart in W&B is likely plotting the value obtained from such a function.
In your charts:

The peak_memory_usage chart shows values around 64-64.5 GB. This means that at some point within some training steps, the memory demand spiked to this level.
The memory_allocated chart (particularly the second one you showed, image_9542c7.png) shows a relatively flat line around 44.2 GB. This is the memory that remains allocated at the point of logging each step. This typically includes model weights, optimizer states, and potentially some persistent buffers.
The difference (around 20 GB) represents the amount of memory that is dynamically allocated and then deallocated within each training step. This is largely due to activations and gradients.
So, it's not that the peak isn't "registered" – it is registered by the underlying memory management system and reported as peak_memory_usage. It's just that the memory_allocated graph is a series of snapshots taken at less frequent intervals, and these snapshots don't necessarily coincide with the exact moment of maximum memory consumption.

give the bf16 have completed the 574 step, fp8 one completed 740 and another 732, can you help me calculate the consumed samples, we should be able to do with the batch size, sequence and steps?





You're absolutely right! We can calculate the consumed samples using the global batch size and the number of steps completed.

From your NeMo configuration file provided earlier, we know:

data.global_batch_size: 128
The sequence length (data.seq_length: 8192) is important for calculating tokens consumed, but for samples consumed, we just need the global batch size and the number of steps.

The formula is:
Consumed Samples = Global Batch Size * Number of Steps

Now, let's calculate for each run:

BF16 Run (bf16_run_slimpajama):

Steps completed = 574
Consumed Samples = 128 samples/step * 574 steps = 73,472 samples
FP8 Run 1 (fp8_run_slimpajama_cs - let's assume this is the orange line):

Steps completed = 740 (assuming this is the one that went further)
Consumed Samples = 128 samples/step * 740 steps = 94,720 samples
FP8 Run 2 (fp8_run_slimpajama - let's assume this is the pink line, a distinct FP8 run):

Steps completed = 732
Consumed Samples = 128 samples/step * 732 steps = 93,696 samples
Let's check this against your consumed_samples chart (image_95a38d.png):

BF16 Run (Purple line): At step 574, the chart shows a value that looks very close to 73,472 (it's roughly between 70,000 and 75,000, and the line is consistent).
FP8 Runs (Orange/Pink lines):
For the run ending around step ~740 (let's say the orange one that goes slightly further on the chart), the chart shows a value a bit above 90,000. Our calculation is 94,720.
For the run ending around step ~732 (pink line), the chart also shows a value slightly above 90,000. Our calculation is 93,696.
The calculations align well with the visual data presented in the consumed_samples chart. The chart itself is essentially plotting global_batch_size * current_step at each point.

So, to summarize:

The BF16 run consumed approximately 73,472 samples.
One FP8 run consumed approximately 94,720 samples.
The other FP8 run consumed approximately 93,696 samples.
This clearly shows that because the FP8 runs were faster per step, they were able to complete more steps and therefore process more data (samples) in what was likely a similar amount of wall-clock time (or within the given experiment's duration).

what does the sample means, it is token? is it sequence, why is sequence length not considered?

how consumed smaples realtes to my data




You're asking excellent questions that get to the core of how data is handled in LLM pre-training! Let's clarify these terms in the context of your NeMo setup.

What does a "sample" mean? Is it a token? Is it a sequence?

In the context of your NeMo LLM pre-training and the "consumed_samples" metric:

A "sample" refers to one complete sequence of tokens that is fed into the model as a single input instance within a micro-batch.
In your configuration, data.seq_length: 8192. This means each "sample" is a sequence of 8192 tokens.
It is not an individual token. A token is the smallest unit (like a word, sub-word, or character) that the tokenizer breaks text into. Many tokens make up a sequence (sample).
So, when your global_batch_size is 128, it means that in one global step, the model processes 128 of these sequences, each 8192 tokens long.

Why is sequence length not considered (in the "consumed_samples" calculation)?

The "consumed_samples" metric is literally a count of how many of these fixed-length sequences have been processed.

The calculation Consumed Samples = Global Batch Size * Number of Steps directly counts these sequences because Global Batch Size itself is defined as the number of sequences per global step.
The sequence_length is implicitly part of what defines a "sample." Each sample has that sequence length.
Where Sequence Length is Considered (for a different, often more common, metric):

While "consumed samples" is a valid metric, a very common and often more informative metric in LLM training is "consumed tokens" or "tokens seen."

To calculate consumed tokens, you would use the sequence length:
Consumed Tokens = Consumed Samples * Sequence Length
Consumed Tokens = Global Batch Size * Number of Steps * Sequence Length

For example, for your BF16 run:

Consumed Samples = 73,472 samples
Consumed Tokens = 73,472 samples * 8192 tokens/sample = 601,823,264 tokens
LLM training progress and dataset sizes are frequently discussed in terms of billions or trillions of tokens (e.g., "trained on 2T tokens"). This metric directly tells you how much textual data, at the token level, your model has processed. W&B often has a "Tokens" x-axis option for its charts if this is logged.

How do "consumed samples" relate to my data (the files in data.paths)?

This is where the data preprocessing pipeline in NeMo comes into play. Your configuration specifies:
data.paths: - /data/path...

Here's the journey from your raw data files to "consumed samples":

a.  Raw Text Documents: The files listed in data.paths (e.g., example_train_1091_text_document) contain raw text. These are your --- documents.

b.  Tokenization: The PreTrainingDataModule reads these text documents. The text is then fed to the tokenizer you specified:
tokenizer: _target_: nemo.collections.common.tokenizers.huggingface.auto_tokenizer.AutoTokenizer pretrained_model_name: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B
This tokenizer converts the raw text from your documents into a stream of numerical token IDs.

c.  Creating Sequences (Samples):
* The continuous stream of tokens generated from your documents is then chunked (or packed) into fixed-length sequences. Your configuration defines this length: seq_length: 8192.
* So, a long document from one of your files will be broken down into multiple sequences of 8192 tokens each. For example, if a document, after tokenization, results in 81,920 tokens, it will contribute 81,920 / 8192 = 10 "samples" to your training dataset.
* If documents are shorter than 8192 tokens, NeMo's data loader might pack multiple short documents together into a single 8192-token sequence to avoid wasting computation on padding (this is a common practice, though the specifics depend on the PreTrainingDataModule's internal settings which aren't fully detailed in this part of the config).

d.  Training: When training starts, the data loader feeds batches of these 8192-token sequences (samples) to the model. Each time the model processes one such sequence, your "consumed_samples" count increases by one for that step's contribution.

In essence:
"Consumed samples" tells you how many 8192-token chunks, derived from the concatenation and processing of all the text in your specified data files, have been used for training the model. Each of these samples represents a continuous segment of text (or packed segments) from your original dataset, formatted to the exact input length your model expects.








what is this chart?




This chart is titled grad_norm, which stands for Gradient Norm.

Let's break down what it represents in the context of your LLM training with NeMo and Weights & Biases, using your corrected color scheme:

Purple Line: bf16_run_slimpajama (BF16 run)
Orange & Pink Lines: fp8_run_slimpajama_cs & fp8_run_slimpajama (FP8 runs)
What Gradient Norm Shows:

Gradient Magnitude: After the backward pass in each training step, gradients are computed for all trainable model parameters. These gradients indicate the direction and magnitude of change needed for each parameter to reduce the loss. The gradient norm is a single scalar value that summarizes the overall "size" or "length" of the entire gradient vector (which is composed of all individual parameter gradients). It's typically calculated as the L2 norm (Euclidean norm) of the flattened gradient vector.

Training Stability and Progress:

Healthy Training: In a well-behaving training run, the gradient norm usually starts relatively high (as the model makes large corrections) and then decreases and stabilizes as the model converges towards an optimum. It might still fluctuate but should ideally remain within a reasonable range.
Exploding Gradients: If the gradient norm shoots up to very large values, it's a sign of "exploding gradients." This can lead to unstable training, where the model parameters change too drastically, often resulting in NaNs (Not a Number) in the loss and parameters, and the model fails to learn.
Vanishing Gradients: If the gradient norm becomes extremely small (close to zero) early in training or for extended periods, it can indicate "vanishing gradients." This means the updates to the model parameters are tiny, and the model learns very slowly or not at all.
Impact of Gradient Clipping:
Your NeMo configuration has optim.config.clip_grad: 1.0. This means that if the gradient norm exceeds 1.0, the gradients will be scaled down so that their norm becomes 1.0. This is a common technique to prevent exploding gradients and stabilize training.

The grad_norm chart you see is likely the norm of the gradients before clipping is applied, or it could be the norm after clipping if clipping occurred. Logging frameworks sometimes offer both. Given the values are well below 1.0 for most of the run, it's possible this is the norm before clipping, or clipping is rarely happening.
Interpreting Your Specific grad_norm Chart:

Initial Phase (Steps ~0-50): All three runs (BF16 in purple, FP8 in orange/pink) start with a relatively high gradient norm (around 0.007 to 0.008). This is typical as the model begins to learn and adjust its random initial weights.
Stabilization (Steps ~50-400): The gradient norm for all runs drops significantly and stabilizes at a much lower value (around 0.001 to 0.002). This is a good sign, suggesting that the initial large corrections have been made, and the learning process is becoming more refined.
BF16 Run (Purple):
Around step 450-500, the bf16_run_slimpajama shows a significant spike in gradient norm, reaching up to ~0.01, followed by another smaller spike. These spikes indicate moments of instability or larger corrections being made by the model.
FP8 Runs (Orange/Pink):
The FP8 runs also show an increase in gradient norm around the same region (step 400 onwards), but their behavior is a bit different.
One of the FP8 runs (pink) has a very large, sharp spike, exceeding 0.015 around step 520. This is a notable event and could indicate a moment of significant training instability for that specific run.
The other FP8 run (orange) shows more moderate fluctuations, generally staying below the peaks of the BF16 run during the later stages, but still exhibiting more variance than in the earlier stable phase.
Later Phase (Steps ~550+): All runs show a generally noisier and slightly elevated gradient norm compared to the very stable phase between steps 50-400. The FP8 runs appear to be somewhat more volatile in this later stage compared to their earlier behavior.
Key Observations and Potential Implications:

Initial Stability: All runs start and stabilize well initially.
Later Instability/Increased Activity: All runs experience some form of increased gradient norm or spikes in the later stages (after ~400 steps). This can happen for various reasons:
The learning rate might still be relatively high for this stage of training, leading to more aggressive updates.
The model might be encountering more challenging or diverse samples in the dataset.
It could be an early sign of overtraining on some aspects of the data, causing larger corrective gradients.
FP8 vs. BF16 Gradient Behavior:
The extremely sharp spike in one of the FP8 runs (pink) is a point of concern. FP8 training can sometimes be more sensitive and might require careful tuning of hyperparameters (like learning rate, weight decay, or even the FP8 scaling factors if they are manually adjustable) to maintain stability. The hybrid FP8 recipe aims to mitigate some of this by keeping certain layers in higher precision, but spikes can still occur.
It's interesting that the BF16 run also shows spikes, suggesting the instability isn't solely an FP8 issue but perhaps related to the model, data, or learning rate schedule at that point in training.
Impact of clip_grad: 1.0: Since all observed gradient norms are significantly below 1.0, gradient clipping is likely not being triggered. This means you are seeing the "natural" norm of the gradients. If these spikes were to approach or exceed 1.0, clipping would activate to prevent them from becoming even larger.
In summary, the grad_norm chart is a vital diagnostic tool:

It helps you monitor the "health" of the training process.
The initial decrease and stabilization are good signs.
The later spikes, especially the very sharp one in an FP8 run, suggest periods of less stable training or the model making large adjustments. While not necessarily catastrophic (as the loss was still going down), these are events to note. If such spikes were much larger or more frequent, they could derail training.
Comparing the grad_norm between different runs (like FP8 vs. BF16) helps you understand if a particular setting is leading to more or less stable gradient behavior.





can you help me to understand the TFLOPs are calculated and how the MFU is calculated basis this?




Okay, let's break down how TFLOPs (TeraFLoating point Operations Per Second) are typically calculated in the context of LLM training and then how Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) is derived from that.

The chart you've provided is TFLOPs_per_GPU.

Purple Line: bf16_run_slimpajama (BF16 run)
Orange & Pink Lines: fp8_run_slimpajama_cs & fp8_run_slimpajama (FP8 runs)
Interpreting Your TFLOPs_per_GPU Chart:

FP8 Runs (Orange/Pink): These runs are achieving a sustained TFLOPs per GPU of around 800-820 after an initial ramp-up. This is a measure of the effective compute throughput your GPUs are delivering.
BF16 Run (Purple): This run is achieving a sustained TFLOPs per GPU of around 620-630.
Observation: The FP8 runs are achieving significantly higher TFLOPs per GPU than the BF16 run. This is expected because FP8 operations are computationally less expensive (require fewer re--- and can be done faster) than BF16 operations on hardware that supports FP8 efficiently (like NVIDIA H100 or newer GPUs). Higher TFLOPs generally lead to faster step times, which you observed in your train_step_timing in s chart.
How TFLOPs_per_GPU is Calculated (Generally):

The exact calculation can be nuanced and depend on the profiling tools, but the core idea is:

Model FLOPs (Floating Point Operations for one Forward/Backward Pass):

First, you need to estimate the total number of floating-point operations required to perform one complete forward pass and one complete backward pass for your specific model architecture (Llama 3 8B in your case) with the given sequence length.
This is a theoretical calculation based on the model's architecture (number of layers, hidden size, attention heads, vocabulary size, sequence length, etc.).
For transformer models, the bulk of the FLOPs come from:
Matrix Multiplications: In the attention mechanism (Q, K, V projections, output projection) and the Feed-Forward Networks (FFN/MLP layers).
Other Operations: Layer normalizations, activations, softmax, etc. (these are usually less dominant than matrix multiplications).
There are established formulas or rules of thumb to estimate this. For example, a common approximation for a GPT-style model's FLOPs for one forward pass is roughly 2 * num_params * seq_len. The backward pass is typically assumed to be 2x the FLOPs of the forward pass. So, a full forward/backward pass is roughly 6 * num_params * seq_len or C * num_params where C is a constant (often around 6 for pre-training like workloads when sequence length effects are amortized or included differently). More precise calculations consider the specific dimensions of weight matrices.
NeMo's FLOPsMeasurementCallback: Your configuration includes:
YAML

- _target_: nemo.lightning.pytorch.callbacks.flops_callback.FLOPsMeasurementCallback
  data_config: ...
  model_config: ...
  model_name: llama3
This callback is specifically designed to estimate or measure the FLOPs for your model. It might use a theoretical model or perform a dry run with profiling to count operations. Let's call this value Model_FLOPs_per_Sample_Pair.
Number of Samples Processed per Step per GPU:

Global_Batch_Size = 128
Micro_Batch_Size = 1 (This is what one GPU processes at a time before gradient accumulation or synchronization at the global step level for its portion)
Accumulate_Grad_Batches = 1
Data_Parallel_Size (DP) = 4 (as calculated before: 8 total GPUs / 2 GPUs per model replica due to CP=2)
Number of samples effectively processed by one GPU's compute units contributing to one global step is Global_Batch_Size / Total_GPUs (if no model parallelism complicated things) or more accurately related to the portion of the global batch its model replica handles.
In your setup, each of the 4 data-parallel ranks processes Global_Batch_Size / DP_Size = 128 / 4 = 32 samples per global step. Since each DP rank uses 2 GPUs for Context Parallelism, each physical GPU is involved in processing these 32 samples.
Time per Step:

This is your train_step_timing in s metric. Let's call it Step_Time_s.
Achieved TFLOPs per GPU Calculation:

The formula for achieved FLOPs per second per GPU is generally:

Achieved_FLOPs_per_GPU_per_s = (Model_FLOPs_for_Global_Batch / Number_of_GPUs) / Step_Time_s

Where Model_FLOPs_for_Global_Batch is the total FLOPs to process the Global_Batch_Size (128 samples). This would be Model_FLOPs_per_Sample_Pair * Global_Batch_Size.

So, Achieved_FLOPs_per_GPU_per_s = (Model_FLOPs_per_Sample_Pair * Global_Batch_Size / Number_of_GPUs) / Step_Time_s

To get TFLOPs (TeraFLOPs), you divide by 10 
12
 :

Achieved_TFLOPs_per_GPU = Achieved_FLOPs_per_GPU_per_s / 10^{12}

The FLOPsMeasurementCallback likely handles these calculations and logs the TFLOPs_per_GPU value you see in W&amp;B. It measures the Step_Time_s and uses its estimate of Model_FLOPs_per_Sample_Pair.

How Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) is Calculated:

MFU tells you what percentage of your GPU's theoretical peak TFLOPs capability you are actually achieving.

Theoretical Peak TFLOPs per GPU:

This value depends on your GPU hardware (e.g., A100, H100) and the precision being used (FP8, BF16, FP16, TF32).
GPU manufacturers publish these peak performance numbers. For example:
NVIDIA H100 SXM: ~1979 TFLOPs for FP8 (with sparsity), ~989 TFLOPs for BF16.
NVIDIA A100: ~624 TFLOPs for TF32 (with sparsity, often used as a proxy for BF16 effective), ~312 TFLOPs for FP16/BF16 (without sparsity).
You need to know the specific GPU model you are using and its corresponding peak TFLOPs for the precision reflected in the TFLOPs_per_GPU chart (e.g., if the TFLOPs are for FP8 computations, use the FP8 peak). Let's call this Peak_Theoretical_TFLOPs_per_GPU.
MFU Calculation:

MFU = (Achieved_TFLOPs_per_GPU / Peak_Theoretical_TFLOPs_per_GPU) * 100%

Example using your numbers (assuming H100 GPUs for illustration):

For FP8 Runs:

Achieved TFLOPs_per_GPU ≈ 810 TFLOPs
Peak_Theoretical_TFLOPs_per_GPU (H100 FP8 with sparsity) ≈ 1979 TFLOPs
MFU_FP8 ≈ (810 / 1979) * 100% ≈ 40.9%
For BF16 Run:

Achieved TFLOPs_per_GPU ≈ 625 TFLOPs
Peak_Theoretical_TFLOPs_per_GPU (H100 BF16) ≈ 989 TFLOPs
MFU_BF16 ≈ (625 / 989) * 100% ≈ 63.2%
Important Considerations for MFU:

Precision Mismatch: The MFU can be misleading if the precision used for the Achieved_TFLOPs_per_GPU (which is an effective rate across various operations) is different from the precision of the Peak_Theoretical_TFLOPs_per_GPU you compare against. For mixed-precision training, it's complex. Often, the BF16 peak is used as a baseline.
Sparsity: Some peak numbers from NVIDIA include benefits from sparsity hardware. Real-world MFU might not always leverage sparsity to the same theoretical extent.
Bottlenecks: MFU is rarely 100% due to various bottlenecks:
Memory Bandwidth: Moving data (weights, activations, gradients) between GPU memory and compute units.
Communication Overhead: Data transfers between GPUs (for data parallelism, tensor parallelism, pipeline parallelism). Your config uses context_parallel_size: 2, which involves communication.
Non-GEMM Operations: Operations other than matrix multiplications (e.g., activations, normalizations) might not utilize the tensor cores as efficiently.
Kernel Launch Overhead: Small operations or inefficiently batched operations.
Software Stack: Efficiency of the libraries (CUDA, cuDNN, PyTorch, NeMo, Megatron-Core).
In your case, the FLOPsMeasurementCallback in NeMo is doing the heavy lifting of estimating the work done (Model_FLOPs_for_Global_Batch) and relating it to the train_step_timing to give you the TFLOPs_per_GPU. If MFU is also logged, it would then compare this achieved TFLOPs to the theoretical peak of your specific GPU hardware for the relevant precision.

The significantly higher MFU for BF16 (63.2%) compared to FP8 (40.9%) in my illustrative example, despite FP8 having higher raw TFLOPs, suggests that the FP8 operations, while fast, might not be scaling as efficiently relative to their own higher theoretical peak, or there are other parts of the pipeline that become bottlenecks when FP8 speeds up the GEMMs. Alternatively, the Achieved_TFLOPs_per_GPU for FP8 might be an "effective" TFLOPs number that is then compared against a BF16 peak, which would make the FP8 MFU appear lower in that comparison context. It's crucial to know what baseline Peak_Theoretical_TFLOPs_per_GPU is used for the MFU calculation if it's provided by NeMo.

what is this memory?




This chart, labeled system/memory, typically refers to the main system RAM (Random Access Memory) usage on the host machine(s) where your training script is running, not the GPU memory.

Weights & Biases (W&B) often prefixes general system-level hardware metrics with system/. So, this chart is tracking the memory utilization of the CPU's RAM over time (in minutes, as indicated by the x-axis). The y-axis likely represents the amount of system RAM used, probably in Gigabytes (GB), though the exact unit isn't specified on the axis (e.g., a value of "10" could mean 10 GB).

Let's distinguish this from the GPU memory metrics we discussed earlier (like peak_memory_usage or memory_allocated specific to GPU devices):

GPU Memory: This is the dedicated high-speed memory on your graphics cards (e.g., HBM on A100s or H100s). It's used to store model parameters, activations, gradients, and optimizer states that are actively involved in the GPU computations. This is usually the most critical memory re--- for LLM training.
System Memory (RAM): This is the memory used by the CPU for the operating system, the Python interpreter, data loading and preprocessing pipelines, storing non-GPU data, buffering data before it's transferred to the GPU, and potentially for CPU-based parts of the optimizer or if parts of the model/data are offloaded to CPU memory (though less common for pure GPU training setups like yours unless using specific techniques like DeepSpeed ZeRO-Infinity).
What contributes to system/memory usage during LLM training?

Operating System and Background Processes: The underlying OS and any other services running on the node.
Python Interpreter and Libraries: The Python process itself and all imported libraries (PyTorch, NeMo, W&B, etc.) consume some RAM.
Data Loading and Preprocessing:
This is often a significant contributor. Even if your data is on a fast Lustre filesystem, data samples are typically read from disk into system RAM.
Tokenization (if done on-the-fly, though often pre-tokenized datasets are used), shuffling, and batching operations might occur in CPU-land and use RAM.
Data loader workers (PyTorch DataLoader with multiple num_workers) will each consume some RAM to prepare batches in parallel.
CPU-Side Buffers: Buffers for transferring data to/from the GPU.
Logging and Monitoring: Tools like W&B itself will use some system memory to collect and transmit metrics.
Optimizer States (Potentially): While your config uses use_distributed_optimizer: true and data_parallel_sharding_strategy: optim_grads_params which heavily implies optimizer states are sharded on the GPUs, some configurations or parts of less distributed optimizers could reside in CPU RAM, or there might be CPU copies for certain operations.
Script Logic: Any other Python objects, variables, or data structures created by your training script.
Interpreting Your Specific system/memory Chart:

X-axis: Time in minutes.
Y-axis: System RAM used (likely GB).
Color Coding (as established):
Teal Line (fp8_run_slimpajama_subch): A new run variant, starts very low (~7.5 GB) and appears to terminate very quickly or logs very few points.
Orange Line (fp8_run_slimpajama_cs): Starts around 9.3 GB, steps up to ~10 GB, then ~10.2 GB, and then makes a very sharp jump to over 12 GB right at the end of its run (~115 minutes).
Pink Line (fp8_run_slimpajama): Starts around 8.2 GB and then plateaus around 8.8 GB for the duration of its run.
Purple Line (bf16_run_slimpajama): Starts around 7.4 GB and plateaus around 7.6 GB for the duration of its run.
Observations from the chart:

Different Baselines: The different runs have different stable system RAM usage levels. The BF16 run uses the least system RAM, followed by one of the FP8 runs (pink), then the other FP8 run (orange), which uses the most during its stable phase.
Step-like Increases: The increases in memory usage often look like steps, which could correspond to new stages in data loading, initialization of certain components, or accumulation of some data in RAM.
Sharp Jump at the End (Orange Line): The orange fp8_run_slimpajama_cs run shows a very significant and abrupt increase in system RAM usage right before it ends. This could be due to several reasons:
End-of-job processes: saving a large checkpoint to disk (which might involve gathering data in RAM first), final logging, or some cleanup process that temporarily requires more memory.
A memory leak that becomes more pronounced or hits a critical point at the end.
The job might have been OOM-killed by the system scheduler (like Slurm) if it exceeded its allocated CPU memory, and W&B is just logging the last known value before termination.
FP8 Runs Using More System RAM: Interestingly, both primary FP8 runs (orange and pink) seem to consume more system RAM on average than the BF16 run. The reasons for this are not immediately obvious from the GPU-centric configuration but could relate to differences in data handling, logging verbosity, or specific CPU-side operations associated with the FP8 setup in your NeMo version.
Why is monitoring system/memory important?

Preventing OOM Kills: If your training job consumes more system RAM than allocated by the cluster scheduler (e.g., Slurm), it can be killed, losing progress.
Identifying Bottlenecks: High system RAM usage might indicate inefficient data loading or preprocessing that could be optimized.
Detecting Memory Leaks: A continuously increasing system/memory usage (not seen here, mostly plateaus or steps) over a very long run could indicate a memory leak in the Python script or one of its libraries.
This chart provides another dimension to understanding your training job's re--- footprint, focusing on the host system rather than just the GPUs.

can you explain me the 2 charts, allocated means ? all GPU memory should be allocated memory, right?




Okay, let's dive into these two new charts, which provide more insights into how your GPU re--- are being utilized, specifically focusing on memory from the perspective of your training process.

Color Coding Recap:

Purple Line: bf16_run_slimpajama (BF16 run)
Orange & Pink Lines: fp8_run_slimpajama_cs & fp8_run_slimpajama (FP8 runs)
Chart 1: Process GPU Memory Allocated (%)

What it shows: This chart displays the percentage of the total available GPU memory on a single GPU that has been allocated by your specific training process.

The y-axis is a percentage (0-100%).
The x-axis is Time (minutes).
"Allocated means? All GPU memory should be allocated memory, right?"
This is a great point to clarify!

Total GPU Memory: Each GPU has a fixed amount of onboard memory (e.g., an NVIDIA A100 might have 40GB or 80GB; an H100 has 80GB). This is the maximum capacity.
Allocated Memory by Process: Your training script (the Python process running NeMo/PyTorch) requests memory from the GPU to store things like:
Model weights and biases
Optimizer states (e.g., moments for Adam)
Activations during the forward pass
Gradients during the backward pass
Temporary buffers for computations
"Process GPU Memory Allocated (%)" shows how much of the GPU's total memory your training process has successfully requested and is currently using (or holding onto).
It's rare for a single process to allocate 100% of the GPU memory. Some memory is typically reserved for:
The CUDA context itself and GPU driver.
Framebuffer for display (though usually minimal on headless server GPUs).
Potentially other processes if the GPU is shared (though for HPC training, GPUs are usually dedicated).
Safety overhead/fragmentation: It's often hard to perfectly pack allocations to use every single byte.
So, "allocated memory" here means the portion of the GPU's total capacity that your training application has actively claimed.
Interpreting Your Chart:

BF16 Run (Purple): This run allocates and maintains around 84-85% of the GPU memory.
FP8 Runs (Orange/Pink): These runs allocate and maintain around 80-81% of the GPU memory.
Observation: The FP8 runs are using a slightly smaller percentage of the total GPU memory compared to the BF16 run. This aligns with our previous observations from the absolute memory charts (peak_memory_usage and memory_allocated in GBs), where FP8 runs generally showed slightly lower memory consumption. This percentage view confirms that relative to the GPU's capacity.
The lines are very flat, indicating stable memory allocation after the initial setup. This is good and expected for long pre-training runs once the model, optimizer, and initial data batches are loaded.
Chart 2: Process GPU Time Spent Accessing Memory (%)

What it shows: This chart is a crucial performance metric. It typically represents the percentage of time the GPU's computational units (like CUDA cores or Tensor Cores) are stalled or waiting because they are trying to read data from or write data to GPU memory. It's often referred to as memory-boundness or related to memory bandwidth utilization.

If this percentage is high, it means the GPU is spending a lot of its time waiting for data rather than doing useful computations. The pipeline is "memory-bound."
If this percentage is low, it means the GPU is "compute-bound," i.e., the computations themselves are the bottleneck, and the memory system can keep up.
The y-axis is a percentage (0-100%).
The x-axis is Time (minutes).
This metric is often derived from profiling counters on the GPU that track memory access patterns and stalls.
Interpreting Your Chart:

BF16 Run (Purple): The GPU spends roughly 40-42% of its time accessing memory (or stalled waiting for it).
FP8 Runs (Orange/Pink): The GPU spends roughly 43-45% of its time accessing memory. One of the FP8 runs (pink) shows a sharp drop to 0% at the very end, which usually indicates the termination of data collection for that run or the end of the process itself.
Observation:
All runs are spending a significant portion of their time (40-45%) with the GPU accessing memory. This is quite common for large transformer models, as they involve moving large weight matrices and activations.
The FP8 runs are spending a slightly higher percentage of time accessing memory compared to the BF16 run. This might seem counter-intuitive at first because FP8 reduces the amount of data. However:
Because FP8 computations are faster (as seen in your higher TFLOPs for FP8), the compute part of the step finishes more quickly. This can expose the memory access time more prominently. If memory access time doesn't reduce proportionally to compute time, its percentage of the total step time can increase.
Even if individual FP8 tensors are smaller, the number of memory transactions or the latency of certain access patterns might not change significantly, or there could be overheads in packing/unpacking or handling FP8 data that contribute to memory access time.
It suggests that while compute is faster with FP8, the workload might be becoming slightly more memory-bandwidth sensitive or the relative time spent on memory operations is higher because the compute part is so much quicker.
Relating to Other Metrics:

The Process GPU Memory Allocated (%) being slightly lower for FP8 makes sense as FP8 tensors take less space.
The Process GPU Time Spent Accessing Memory (%) being slightly higher for FP8, combined with significantly higher TFLOPs_per_GPU and faster train_step_timing for FP8, paints a picture:
FP8 is indeed making your computations (the FLOPs-intensive parts) run much faster.
Because the compute is faster, the proportion of time spent waiting for memory becomes more apparent. The overall step time is still better for FP8, but this chart highlights that memory access is a key factor influencing performance for all runs, and its relative impact is slightly more noticeable in the faster FP8 configuration.
In summary:

Process GPU Memory Allocated (%) confirms FP8 uses slightly less of the total GPU memory capacity. "Allocated" refers to what your specific training process is using, not the entire GPU capacity.
Process GPU Time Spent Accessing Memory (%) shows all runs have a significant dependency on memory access (40-45% of time). The FP8 runs show this slightly more, likely because their compute phases are accelerated, making the (still present) memory access phases a larger fraction of the now shorter step time. This metric is key for understanding if you are compute-bound or memory-bound. A value around 40-50% often indicates a workload that is quite balanced or somewhat memory-bandwidth sensitive, which is typical for LLMs.

explain these




Okay, let's break down these six GPU monitoring charts from your Weights & Biases dashboard. These provide a great overview of the health and utilization of your GPU re--- during the training runs.

Recap of Color Coding:

Purple Line: bf16_run_slimpajama (BF16 run)
Orange & Pink Lines: fp8_run_slimpajama_cs & fp8_run_slimpajama (FP8 runs)
1. Process GPU Temperature (°C)

What it shows: This chart displays the temperature of the GPU(s) being used by your training process, measured in degrees Celsius. Since the lines for each run type (BF16, FP8) are very smooth and consolidated, this might be an average across the GPUs used by that run, or all GPUs are operating at nearly identical temperatures.
Interpretation of Your Chart:
All runs (BF16 and FP8 variants) show the GPU temperature stabilizing around a cool 55°C after an initial warm-up.
The pink FP8 run shows a sharp drop at the end, which corresponds to that run finishing and the GPU cooling down.
Significance: 55°C under load is an excellent temperature. It indicates very effective cooling for your GPUs. This means your GPUs are likely not being thermally throttled and can sustain their peak performance.
2. Process GPU Utilization (%)

What it shows: This metric indicates how much of the GPU's computational power is being actively used by your training process. A value of 100% means the GPU's processing units (CUDA cores, Tensor Cores) are fully engaged.
Interpretation of Your Chart:
All runs (BF16 and FP8) rapidly reach and maintain close to 100% GPU utilization.
The pink FP8 run drops to 0% upon completion.
Significance: This is ideal. It means your training job is effectively keeping the GPUs busy, maximizing throughput. It suggests no major CPU or data I/O bottlenecks are preventing the GPUs from doing work.
3. GPU Power Usage (W)

What it shows: The electrical power consumed by each individual GPU, measured in Watts (W). The legend indicates multiple lines for each run (e.g., fp8_run_slimpajama_cs GPU 0 Power Usage (W), ... GPU 1 Power Usage (W), etc.), representing each GPU involved in the training.
Interpretation of Your Chart:
For each active run, the power usage lines for all its GPUs (GPU 0, GPU 1, GPU 2, GPU 3 are shown in the legend hints) are almost perfectly overlaid. This is a strong indicator of excellent load balancing across your GPUs.
All runs (BF16 and FP8) show each GPU drawing approximately 700W.
The pink FP8 run's GPUs show power dropping off as the run finishes.
Significance: 700W is a very high power draw, typical of high-performance data center GPUs (like NVIDIA H100s) operating near their maximum capacity. This, combined with 100% utilization, means the GPUs are working at their full potential.
4. GPU Power Usage (%)

What it shows: The GPU power consumption as a percentage of its maximum rated power, often referred to as its Thermal Design Power (TDP).
Interpretation of Your Chart:
Similar to the absolute power usage, the lines for different GPUs within the same run are very consistent.
All active runs show GPUs operating at or very close to 100% of their TDP.
The pink FP8 run shows a drop at the end.
Significance: This confirms the GPUs are being pushed to their power limits, which is generally desired for achieving maximum computational throughput, assuming the system can handle the power delivery and cooling (which your temperature chart suggests it can).
5. GPU Memory Allocated (Bytes)

What it shows: The absolute amount of memory allocated on each GPU by your training process, measured in Bytes. The legend shows lines for individual GPUs.
Interpretation of Your Chart:
The memory allocation is very consistent across all GPUs within a given run.
BF16 Run (Purple): Each GPU allocates approximately 7.0e+10 bytes (which is 70 Gigabytes).
FP8 Runs (Orange/Pink): Each GPU allocates slightly less, around 6.8e+10 bytes (which is 68 Gigabytes).
The pink FP8 run shows deallocation at the end.
Significance: This confirms that FP8 provides a slight memory saving per GPU. If your GPUs have 80GB of memory (e.g., H100 80GB), this means BF16 is using about 87.5% (70/80) and FP8 is using about 85% (68/80) of the available memory on each GPU for process allocations. The consistency across GPUs is important for balanced distributed training.
6. GPU Memory Allocated (%)

What it shows: The percentage of total available memory on each GPU that is allocated by your training process. This is essentially the percentage representation of the previous chart.
Interpretation of Your Chart:
Highly consistent across GPUs within each run.
BF16 Run (Purple): Around 87-88% (consistent with ~70GB on an 80GB card).
FP8 Runs (Orange/Pink): Around 85% (consistent with ~68GB on an 80GB card).
The pink FP8 run shows a drop at the end.
Significance: This provides a relative measure that's easy to interpret regardless of the exact GPU memory capacity. It confirms high memory utilization and the slight memory advantage of FP8.
Overall Summary from these Charts:

Peak Hardware Performance: Your training jobs are driving the GPUs to their maximum utilization and power limits.
Excellent Thermal Management: GPU temperatures are kept low, ensuring no performance throttling due to heat.
Effective Load Balancing: All monitored metrics (power, memory) are very consistent across the multiple GPUs used in each run, indicating your distributed training strategy (as per the NeMo config) is working well to distribute the workload evenly.
FP8 Efficiency: FP8 runs maintain this high level of hardware utilization while offering slightly lower GPU memory consumption.
These charts indicate a very healthy and efficiently run training environment where you are getting the most out of your GPU hardware.

explain




Okay, let's examine this new set of six charts. Three of them are familiar, and three are new, giving us insights into network and disk activity.

Recap of Color Coding:

Purple Line: bf16_run_slimpajama (BF16 run)
Orange Line: fp8_run_slimpajama_cs (FP8 run)
Pink Line: fp8_run_slimpajama (another FP8 run)
Teal Line: fp8_run_slimpajama_subch (a shorter/partial FP8 run variant)
Familiar Charts (Top Row):

1. GPU Time Spent Accessing Memory (%)

What it shows: The percentage of time GPU computational units are stalled waiting for memory access. The legend now clearly shows individual lines for GPU 0, 1, 2, and 3 for the fp8_run_slimpajama_cs run.
Interpretation:
The lines for individual GPUs (0, 1, 2, 3) within the fp8_run_slimpajama_cs (orange) run are very tightly clustered around 43-45%. This reconfirms excellent load balancing even at this granular level of memory access behavior.
The other runs (pink and purple, not explicitly broken down by GPU in this particular legend view, but assumed to be similar based on previous charts) also show their characteristic levels (pink around 43-45%, purple around 40-42%).
Significance: Consistent memory access patterns and timings across GPUs are good. As discussed before, these values suggest a workload that is significantly influenced by memory bandwidth.
2. GPU Temperature (°C)

What it shows: Temperature of individual GPUs.
Interpretation:
Again, individual GPUs for the fp8_run_slimpajama_cs run (and by extension, the other runs) are all stable around 55°C.
Significance: Excellent cooling and stable operating temperatures for all GPUs.
3. GPU Utilization (%)

What it shows: Computational utilization of individual GPUs.
Interpretation:
All individual GPUs for the fp8_run_slimpajama_cs run (and others) are pegged at or very near 100%.
Significance: Maximum computational engagement of all GPUs.
New Charts (Bottom Row):

4. Network Traffic (Bytes)

What it shows: This chart tracks the amount of network data being sent and received by the node, measured in Bytes. This is crucial for distributed training where GPUs on different nodes (or even within a node, depending on the interconnects for inter-GPU communication if it's routed via network stack) communicate gradients, activations, or model parameters.
Interpretation:
fp8_run_slimpajama_subch Network Traffic Received (Bytes) (Teal - Received): Shows a baseline very close to zero.
fp8_run_slimpajama_subch Network Traffic Sent (Bytes) (Teal - Sent): Also shows a baseline very close to zero. This run was very short.
fp8_run_slimpajama_cs Network Traffic Received (Bytes) (Orange - Received): Starts near zero, then shows a massive, near-vertical spike to over 6e+11 bytes (600 GB) around the 30-minute mark, and then seems to flatline or data collection stops for this specific metric for this run.
fp8_run_slimpajama_cs Network Traffic Sent (Bytes) (Orange - Sent): Shows a similar pattern – a massive spike in data sent (also around 600 GB) at the same time.
The fp8_run_slimpajama (pink) and bf16_run_slimpajama (purple) lines are not clearly visible or are flat along the bottom, suggesting either they had very little network traffic captured by this specific metric, or the Y-axis scale is dominated by the spike from the orange run.
Significance:
The massive spike for the fp8_run_slimpajama_cs run is highly unusual for typical inter-GPU communication during training steps unless it represents something specific like:
A one-time large data transfer (e.g., downloading a dataset or model, though less likely mid-run for "network traffic" this way).
A huge burst of communication related to checkpoint saving to a network location, or a very large distributed save operation.
Potentially an issue with metric collection or a very specific type of inter-node communication if your num_nodes was > 1 for that run (your provided config had num_nodes: 1, but perhaps it changed for this run). If it's a single-node run, this level of "network" traffic (if not inter-GPU via NVLink/PCIe reported as network) is odd.
If this is truly inter-GPU communication within a node being reported here, it's an enormous amount. Regular gradient all-reduces are typically smaller and more frequent.
The lack of similar spikes for other runs is noteworthy. This specific event needs context from that fp8_run_slimpajama_cs run.
5. Disk I/O Utilization (MB)

What it shows: The amount of data read from and written to disk by the process, measured in Megabytes (MB). This tracks how much your training job is interacting with storage.
Interpretation:
fp8_run_slimpajama_subch MB read from disk (Teal - Read): Shows a small initial read, then flat.
fp8_run_slimpajama_cs MB read from disk (Orange - Read): Shows an initial read of about 10,000 MB (10 GB) and then stays flat for a long period. Towards the end, there's another smaller read.
fp8_run_slimpajama MB read from disk (Pink - Read): Shows a similar initial read of about 10 GB, then flat.
bf16_run_slimpajama MB read from disk (Purple - Read): Shows a significantly larger initial read, around 70,000 MB (70 GB), and then stays flat.
Writes (MB written to disk lines for all): All runs show very minimal, almost negligible disk writes throughout most of their duration, staying close to zero. The purple line (BF16) shows a slight uptick in writes near its end.
Significance:
Initial Reads: The large initial disk reads are almost certainly the dataset being loaded into memory (either system RAM or directly mapped for GPU access if using specific data loaders). The BF16 run reading significantly more data initially (70GB vs 10GB for FP8 runs) is peculiar if they are using the exact same dataset paths. This could imply:
Different dataset caching mechanisms.
The BF16 run perhaps loaded more data shards or a larger portion of the dataset upfront.
Different data loader configurations.
Minimal Writes: The low disk write activity during the main training phase is good. It means checkpointing (if enabled and frequent) isn't causing major I/O slowdowns, or it's very infrequent. Frequent, large writes can be an I/O bottleneck. The slight increase in writes at the end of the BF16 run could be it saving a final checkpoint.
6. Disk Utilization (GB)

What it shows: This chart typically represents the total disk space used by a particular filesystem or mount point that W&B is monitoring, not the I/O rate. The Y-axis values (e.g., 51.79 to 51.8) are very precise and very close to each other.
Interpretation:
All lines (fp8_run_slimpajama_subch, fp8_run_slimpajama_cs, fp8_run_slimpajama, bf16_run_slimpajama) are extremely flat and clustered around 51.8 GB.
There is virtually no change in this value over time for any of the runs.
Significance:
This indicates that the total used space on the monitored disk partition is stable at around 51.8 GB and is not significantly changing due to these training runs.
This doesn't mean your job isn't writing anything (the "Disk I/O - MB written" chart shows small writes). It just means these writes are not large enough to make a noticeable dent in the overall disk utilization at the GB scale, or they are overwriting temporary files, or the monitored disk is a system disk and not where large checkpoints/datasets are primarily stored if those are on a separate, larger Lustre filesystem as your data paths suggest.
If this monitored disk is where your operating system, code, and potentially some small local caches reside, then its stability is normal. Your large datasets are on /lustre/, which might not be the disk whose total utilization is being reported here.
Key Takeaways from New Charts:

Network Traffic: The huge, isolated spike in network traffic for the fp8_run_slimpajama_cs run is the most anomalous event here and needs further investigation based on that run's specific context (e.g., was it multi-node, was a large save/load operation to a network target performed?).
Disk Reads: The initial large disk reads correspond to dataset loading. The significant difference in initial read volume between the BF16 run and the FP8 runs is interesting and suggests a difference in how data was accessed or cached at the start of those jobs.
Disk Writes & Overall Disk Utilization: Minimal disk writes during training are generally good for performance. The total disk utilization (of the monitored partition) remaining stable is expected if large data artifacts (checkpoints, datasets) are stored elsewhere or if writes are small.
The top row of GPU charts continues to show excellent, well-balanced, and high-performance GPU operation. The bottom row introduces system-level I/O, highlighting a peculiar network event and an interesting difference in initial data read patterns.
